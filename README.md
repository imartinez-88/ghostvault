# Vault Prototype 
Â© This project and all associated ideas, design, and implementation are the sole intellectual property of Isaac Martinez (imartinez-88). Not affiliated with or licensed to any employer or contractor.

This vault skeleton is a browser-based secure access system built with multi-layered client-side authentication. It simulates key components of a modern zero-trust vault, including biometric WebAuthn, RSA key encryption, and AES-GCM file protection.

## Features
- Pattern-based user unlock system
- Biometric authentication via WebAuthn
- RSA-OAEP key pair generation (4096-bit)
- AES-GCM 256-bit encryption
- Vault `.json` + private key `.pem` upload
- Fully client-side encryption & decryption flow

## Current Status
**Phase 1.A â€“ Pattern & Biometric Auth: **  
**Phase 1.B â€“ Vault Decryption Skeleton: ** 
**Phase 2 - Foregn PCK#12 integration wtih X.509 Cert Signature **

## Built With
- JavaScript (Web Crypto API)
- HTML/CSS UI
- WebAuthn
- AES-GCM & RSA-OAEP encryption

## Next Steps
- Finalize vault decryption display
- UI error handling & user feedback
- Implement secure in-browser key caching
